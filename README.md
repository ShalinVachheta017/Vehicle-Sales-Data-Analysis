# 🏎️ USA Vehicle Sales Data Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **USA vehicle sales data** to uncover meaningful insights regarding vehicle trends, brand popularity, pricing patterns, and seasonal demand. By leveraging **data analysis and visualization techniques**, we aim to provide a data-driven understanding of the automobile sales industry.

## ✨ Objectives
- Perform **data cleaning and preprocessing** to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
- Conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to extract insights.
- Identify **brand popularity**, **price trends**, and **sales distribution** across different regions.
- Examine **seasonal patterns** and their impact on sales.
- Implement **predictive modeling** to forecast future vehicle sales.

## 📊 Key Achievements
- **Uncovered 30% sales spikes in July and 20% dips in December** by analyzing **50,0000+ U.S. vehicle sales records**.
- **Identified SUV dominance (45% market share)** and **regional trends (North Region: 38% of sales)** using Pandas grouping/filtering.
- Determined **seasonal trends** to optimize **targeted marketing campaigns and roll-out offers**.
- **Automated data standardization with NumPy**, enabling scalable insights for **personalized marketing strategies**.
- Analyzed **price elasticity** and its impact on demand using correlation and regression analysis.

## 📚 Dataset Information
The dataset consists of vehicle sales data with various attributes, including:
- **Vehicle Type** (Sedan, SUV, Truck, etc.)
- **Brand & Model**
- **Manufacturing Year**
- **Price**
- **Sales Date**
- **Sales Volume**
- **Region/State**

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
- **Python** for data manipulation and analysis.
