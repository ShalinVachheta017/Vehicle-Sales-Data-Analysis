# 🏎️ USA Vehicle Sales Data Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **USA vehicle sales data** to uncover meaningful insights regarding vehicle trends, brand popularity, pricing patterns, and seasonal demand. By leveraging **data analysis and visualization techniques**, we aim to provide a data-driven understanding of the automobile sales industry.

## ✨ Objectives
- Perform **data cleaning and preprocessing** to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
- Conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to extract insights.
- Identify **brand popularity**, **price trends**, and **sales distribution** across different regions.
- Examine **seasonal patterns** and their impact on sales.
- Implement **predictive modeling** to forecast future vehicle sales.

## 📚 Dataset Information
The dataset consists of vehicle sales data with various attributes, including:
- **Vehicle Type** (Sedan, SUV, Truck, etc.)
- **Brand & Model**
- **Manufacturing Year**
- **Price**
- **Sales Date**
- **Sales Volume**
- **Region/State**

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
- **Python** for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data processing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook** for exploratory analysis.
